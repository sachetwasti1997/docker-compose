Docker Network:
    - Group of containers such that each container knows to talk to each other.
    - It allows us to separate group of containers from another group of containers
* Every time a container is created docker attaches it to a separate network, thus the only
  way to connect to a container is by port binding  

** swasti@192 ~ % docker network ls // lists all the networks present
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
46ecf48bc751   bridge    bridge    local
735e5a6461fd   host      host      local
1758f7245103   none      null      local

These three networks are created when docker is installed
Here there is a column called DRIVER
** DRIVER identifies the behaviour of the network
---> If we take a container and attach to a network whose DRIVER is NULL, then it will prevent all network
     access from that container
---> If we connect container to network whose driver type is bridge then only the containers
     inside the network will be able to connect to each other
---> The network with the driver type host allows direct access from the localhost

We can see that for a image running docker by default creates a network
If we do not specify a network while creating docker image, by default it will create the image
in the first bridge nework that is available

**** docker network create net1 ****
This command will create by default a bridge network
